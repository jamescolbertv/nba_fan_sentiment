# Project Overview:
- Search and pull down NBA team tweets using hashtag (i.e, #Lakers). Pull down *n* tweets, and perform sentiment analysis on them.
- Determine whether NBA fans of teams are happy or sad using sentiment analysis.
- Visualize data in an interesting way - maybe bar charts showing which teams are happiest and saddest.
## Optional/wish-list
- Allow drill-down for each team, which would display top ten trending topics for the team (is this possible?)
