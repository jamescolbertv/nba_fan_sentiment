# Project Overview:
<<<<<<< HEAD
- Search and pull down NBA team tweets using # (i.e, #Lakers). Pull down *n* tweets, and perform sentiment analysis on them.
- Add all team hashtags into a list, then search through a large number of tweets to find NBA team hashtags within tweets. For example, search through 100,000 recent tweets and find all tweets that have team hashtag in them.

- Determine whether NBA fans of teams are happy or sad using sentiment analysis.
- Visualize data in an interesting way - maybe bar charts showing which teams are happiest and saddest.
## Optional/wish-list
- Allow drill-down for each team, which would display top ten trending topics for the team (is this possible?)
